**Cameroon** is a country on the Central West coast of Africa bordering the Atlantic Ocean. After changing hands between several European powers, including *Portugal* and *Germany*, it became a joint territory of *France and the United Kingdom* after World War I, before gaining its outright independence in 1961. Most of its inhabitants today speak French, as well as their native language.


## Major Cities

### Yaoundé
The capital city of Cameroon is **Yaoundé**, which is located in the central part of the country, up in the mountains. Yaoundé is known as the *city of seven hills* because of its topography, though a more accurate number might be in the hundreds, a fact that leads to marvelous tropical vistas around every corner of the city. 
### Douala
Cameroon's largest city is **Douala**, located on the delta of the Wouri River as it flows out to the Atlantic. It is a lot more humid than its mountainous counterpart, making the city feel much hotter in the dry season, which runs from November to May. Many travel sites describe the city as *icky and sticky* for this reason. Though the city is very flat, on a perfectly clear day, Mount Cameroon can be spotted in the distance.

## My Experience
During 2021-22, I spent a total of 15 months in Cameroon on a proselyting mission for my Church. I spent 6 months in Yaoundé, followed by 9 months in Douala. I got to live and work in these two cities and act like a local - ride the taxis, buy the fresh market produce, and speak the language. It was an amazing experience and I'd like to return someday.
